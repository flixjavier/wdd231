			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Onions are a versatile and essential ingredient in cuisines worldwide,
				known for their pungent flavor and distinctive aroma. They belong to the
				Allium family, which includes garlic, leeks, and chives. Onions come in
				various types, such as yellow, red, and white, each with its unique
				taste and culinary applications. Beyond their culinary uses, onions have
				been valued for their health benefits for centuries. They are rich in
				vitamins C and B6, folate, and dietary fiber. Additionally, onions
				contain a variety of antioxidants, including quercetin, which is known
				for its anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				The health benefits of onions extend beyond their nutritional content.
				They possess antimicrobial properties that can help fight infections,
				and their high sulfur content may support heart health by reducing
				cholesterol levels and improving blood pressure. Onions also contain
				prebiotics, which promote gut health by feeding beneficial bacteria in
				the digestive system. Their potential cancer-fighting properties are
				being studied, with some research suggesting that regular consumption of
				onions may reduce the risk of certain cancers due to their high
				antioxidant levels. Overall, incorporating onions into your diet can
				contribute to overall health and well-being.
